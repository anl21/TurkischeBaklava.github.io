## Essential "pieces" necessary for defining and learning any programming language: 

* **Syntax**: How do you write the various parts of the language?
* **Semantics**: What do the various language features mean? For example, how are expressions evaluated?
* **Idioms**: What are the common approaches to using the language features to express computations?
* **Libraries**: What has already been written for you? How do you do things you could not do without
library support (like access files, data structers)?
* **Tools**: What is available for manipulating programs in the language (compilers, read-eval-print loops,
debuggers, ...)
